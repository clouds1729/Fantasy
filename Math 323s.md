### Plane Geometry
- Configurations of points + lines in the "plane". The discussion involves undefined terms whose properties are constrained by axioms.
#### Undefined Terms

Points, Lines, Incidence, Betweenness, Congruence

#### Axiom

- Any two distinct points lie on a unique line ("P lies on L means P is incident with $l$"). A line l passes through P means "P is incident with $l$"
- Euclid assumed that if three points $A,B,C$ are incident with a line $l$, then one of them is **between** the other two.

#### Definition

- Given two distinct points the **segment** $AB$ is the set of points that are either $A$ or $B$ or lie between $A$ and $B$. 
- A rays $AB$ is the set of points $C$ such that either $C$ lies on $AB$ or $B$ is between $A$ and $C$.
