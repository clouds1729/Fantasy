## $\textbf{Problem 10}$

In each of Problems 7 through 12, state where in the $ty$-plane the hypotheses of Theorem 2.4.2

are satisfied.
$$y'=(t^2+y^2)^{3/2}$$
## $\mathbf{Solution}$

According to Theorem 2.4.2, a unique solution to
$$y'=f(t,y),\quad y(t_0)=y_0$$
exists in some interval $t_0-h<t<t_0+h$ within $\alpha<t<\beta$, provided that $f$ and $\partial f/\partial y$ are
continuous in a rectangle $\alpha<t<\beta,\gamma<y<\delta$ that contains $(t_0,y_0).$ In this exercise
$$f(t,y)=(t^2+y^2)^{3/2}\quad\text{and}\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\frac32(t^2+y^2)^{1/2}(2y)=3y(t^2+y^2)^{1/2}.$$
$f$ is continuous everywhere, and $\partial f/\partial y$ is continuous everywhere. Therefore, the hypotheses of
Theorem 2.4.2 are satisfied everywhere.

## Duality and normal transformations

The dual of a vector space $V$ over a feld $F$ is the vector space $V^d=$ $\mathcal{L}(V,F)$ of linear functionals $f:V\to F.$ If $V$ is of fnite dimension and $B=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ is a basis of $V$ then the basis that is dual to $B$ is $B^d=\{v_1^d,\ldots,v_n^d\}$ where each $v_i^d:V\to F$ is given by
$$\left.v_i^d(v_j)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\quad\mathrm{if~}i=j;\\0&\quad\mathrm{if~}i\neq j.\end{array}\right.\right.$$
$\textbf{Problem 26}$
